# marionette-quickhaq
Basic project structure for new marionette projects.

After fooling around with [marionette-wires](https://github.com/thejameskyle/marionette-wires), which provides a structure for
a modularized [marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) application, and also with 
[npm-scripts-example](https://github.com/keithamus/npm-scripts-example), which shows nice ways of building your project
without the added complexity of a build automation tool like gulp, this is my shot at a basic, empty project setup.
I will need this for some private projects.
